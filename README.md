# Customer_Segmentation_ML
In this Data Science Python Project series, we will perform one of the most essential applications of machine learning â€“ Customer Segmentation. In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in R. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology.  In this machine learning project, DataFlair will provide you the background of customer segmentation. Then we will explore the data upon which we will be building our segmentation model. Also, in this data science project, we will see the descriptive analysis of our data and then implement several versions of the K-means algorithm.
